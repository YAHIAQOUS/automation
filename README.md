# Lab: 18 - Cryptography

## Overview

A colleague has abruptly left the team to pursue a career as a novelist.

This colleague’s last days (and weeks) on the job were a mixed bag in terms of productivity.

Looking through the documents left behind there is some important contact info in the form of email addresses and phone numbers.

Unfortunately it’s mixed in with a bunch of useless notes.

Your job is to find the needles in the haystack.
